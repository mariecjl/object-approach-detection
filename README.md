ABOUT: "Real-time object approach detection through PyTorch's MiDaS monocular depth estimation and OpenCV (live video stream). Computes per-frame depth maps, smooths temporal noise, and detects approaching objects with spatial filtering + temporal confirmation."

Real-time object approach detection system using a webcam and monocular depth estimation from MiDaS.

Features
- Real-time webcam stream processing with OpenCV
- Monocular depth estimation using MiDaS small
- Temporal depth smoothing to reduce noise
- Adaptive tresholding using median absolute deviation
- Spatial filtering with waiting on center
- Temporal confirmation to reduce noise and false positives
- Displays and follows approaching object in red bounding box.
